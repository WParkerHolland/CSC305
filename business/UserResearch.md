Observation 2:

○ Observation Statement: When prompting the users about how they would like to be able to post their writing prompts, the majority of the users prefered anonymous posting.

○ Supporting Data: Out of the four options in the question, 57.1% chose Publicly, 89.8% chose Anonymously, 67.3% chose To Friends Only and only 40.8% chose Privately.

○ Team Action (if any): This data will determine the order in which each feature will be implemented. Since Anonymously was selected by almost 90% of users, that will be first followed by To Friends Only, Publicly and Privately.

Observation 3:

○ Observation Statement:
 More users wanted prompts to be 10 or 15 minutes as opposed to five.

○ Supporting Data:
Out of the 49 users that took the survey, 20 users wanted 15 minutes and 18 users wanted 10 minutes, which is 77.5% of the survey takers. Additionally, only 6 takers, or 12.2% of the takers, liked the idea of 5 minute writing prompts. 
 
○ Team Action (if any): We will change the time constraint to 15 minutes long. 

- Observation 4:
  - Observation Statement: We observed that if people are given a more difficult prompt, they would like the time to scale with its difficulty.
  - Supporting Data: In our survey, we asked a question "Should the time limit scale based off of the complexity of the writing prompt?". Out of the 49 respondents, 46 of them answered "yes" to that question, while only 3 answered "no".
  - Team Action: To act on this data, we will make sure to increase the time complexity if we offer the option of a more difficult prompt.
