- Net Promoter Score - After the user finishes responding to the daily prompt, they will be sent to a confirmation screen that will ask them to rate their experience on a scale of 1 to 10. Responding to this question will be optional so it is not too intrusive. We will need to add a new screen in thunkable for this purpose.
- User Rating Frequency - This will be a measurement of how often each user rates their experience after responding to the daily prompt. We will collect this by recording how many times the user rates the app and comparing that number to the total number of prompts they have responded to.
- Average Prompt Rating - Alongside asking the user to rate their experience after responding to the prompt, we will ask them to rate the prompt they just responded to on a scale of 1 to 10. This would also be optional, but it would let us know if the prompts we are providing the users are good or not. We will need to add another text box and some code to the confirmation screen, and possibly a cloud function to do the calculations to avoid slowing down the user's phone.
- Churn - We'll calculate churn by dividing the number of users who stopped engaging with our app during a specific period by the total number of users at the beginning of that period. This helps us identify any potential issues causing users to churn and allows us to take necessary actions. We'll monitor the churn rate regularly to keep track of user retention trends.
- CTR for responding to the daily prompt - Monitoring the Click-Through Rate (CTR) is essential for understanding how many users respond to our daily prompts after seeing them. We'll track the number of users who view the daily prompt and compare it to the number of users who actually respond to it. This will help us gauge the effectiveness of our prompts in engaging our users. Calculating CTR involves dividing the number of users who respond to the prompt by the number of users who viewed it, then multiplying by 100 to get a percentage.
- Amount of time users take to reach/respond to the prompt - We'll record the timestamp when a user opens the app and views the prompt, and another timestamp when they submit their response. By calculating the time difference between these two timestamps, we can determine the response time. Analyzing response times helps us identify trends and outliers, enabling us to improve the prompt delivery and user experience.
- Adoption Rate - The way we will track the adoption rate is by tracking the total number of users that have downloaded the app or registered, and using it to calculate how many users weâ€™ve acquired at different points. For example if we have the total numbers of downloads we can use it to calculate the adoption rate after the release of a new feature by dividing the number of new adoptions after a new feature is released by the total number of adoptions.
- Download Rate / Registration Rate - The download rate will simply be the amount of users that download the app after a new feature is added. The registration rate will be used to see how many people who downloaded the product actually registered.
- Retention Rates - The retention rate will be measured by recording the amount of responses starting from launch or when a new feature is released and tracking the number of responses submitted each month after. This will help us see how many people are continuing to use the product.
