- Net Promoter Score - After the user finishes responding to the daily prompt, they will be sent to a confirmation screen that will ask them to rate their experience on a scale of 1 to 10. Responding to this question will be optional so it is not too intrusive. We will need to add a new screen in thunkable for this purpose.
- User Rating Frequency - This will be a measurement of how often each user rates their experience after responding to the daily prompt. We will collect this by recording how many times the user rates the app and comparing that number to the total number of prompts they have responded to.
- Average Prompt Rating - Alongside asking the user to rate their experience after responding to the prompt, we will ask them to rate the prompt they just responded to on a scale of 1 to 10. This would also be optional, but it would let us know if the prompts we are providing the users are good or not. We will need to add another text box and some code to the confirmation screen, and possibly a cloud function to do the calculations to avoid slowing down the user's phone.
- DAU - We will create a counter for whenever a unique user logs into the app for the first time from 12 am at midnight to 11:59 pm every day. Firebase helps track unique logins, so we can track this through firebase.
- Count of Times User Opens App - Similarly to DAU, firebase tracks how many times each account gets logged into every day, so we can take this value that occurs for each day to record this metric
- Average Prompt Streak - This can be recorded as a JSON Property for each profile. Every time a user answers the daily writing prompt, the user can visibly see their streak go up by 1. We can push all profiles to a spreadsheet and take the average of all the streaks to get a solid idea of how many people come back to the app.
