A/B Test Name: Logout screen
User Story Number: 4
Metric (from the HEART grid): NPS and CTR

Hypothesis: By adding an additional screen for signing out with clear instructions and options, users will find it easier to complete the sign-out process, resulting in higher NPS scores and increased CTR on other app features.

Experiment: For the experiment setup, we will use Firebase Remote Config to implement the A/B test. We will allocate 50% of our user base to the experiment group (Group A) and the remaining 50% to the control group (Group B).

Rationale - Allocating 50% of users to each group ensures that we have a large enough sample size to draw meaningful conclusions from the experiment. Along with splitting the users evenly between the experiment and control groups helps minimize bias and ensures that any differences in outcomes can be attributed to the variations being tested rather than other factors.

Tracking Using Firebase Analytics - Set up event tracking in Firebase Analytics to monitor user responses to the NPS survey before and after the experiment. Track events related to the survey display, user responses, and overall NPS calculation. Also implement event tracking to monitor the click-through rate on other app features for both the experiment and control groups. Track events related to user interactions with different app features to measure changes in engagement.

Variations:
Control Variation (Group B):
Users in this group will experience the existing sign-out process without any modifications. This serves as our baseline for comparison.

Experiment Variation (Group A):
Users in this group will be presented with an additional screen for signing out, which includes clear instructions and options for confirmation. This variation aims to streamline the sign-out process and improve user experience.
