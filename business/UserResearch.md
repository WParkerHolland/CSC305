- Observation 3:

  - Observation Statement:
 More users wanted prompts to be 10 or 15 minutes as opposed to five.
  - Supporting Data:
Out of the 49 users that took the survey, 20 users wanted 15 minutes and 18 users wanted 10 minutes, which is 77.5% of the survey takers. Additionally, only 6 takers, or 12.2% of the takers, liked the idea of 5 minute writing prompts. 
  - Team Action (if any): We will change the time constraint to 15 minutes long.
